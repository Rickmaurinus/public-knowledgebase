# Enforcing materializations with ORDER BY FALSE in subselects, views or CTEs 
Sometimes it is useful to enforce a materialization of a subselect (or view or CTE) by adding an ORDER BY FALSE to it.  
Those cases include:

1. Late applied filter (see attached, pdf)
2. Replace global by local join (by enforcing a materialization of a subselect that is smaller than replication border [see [replication-border-in-exasol-6-1](https://exasol.my.site.com/s/article/Replication-border-in-Exasol-6-1)] with local filters)
3. Manual precalculation of multiple usages of subselects, views, CTEs

Please be aware that materializations can cause a lot of temporary data if they are big which might result in block swapping and decrease thoughput
