# Backup of only selected schemas 
## Problem

It's currently not possible to include only specified schemas or to exclude some schemas from the backup process.  
The backup "knows" nothing about schemas or other database objects.

## Solution

It is - however - possible to restore only some data by starting a backup in a virtual access mode and transfer the requested data manually by using IMPORT/EXPORT commands.
