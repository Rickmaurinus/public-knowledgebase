# Preprocessor Scripts explained 
## Background

#### What does a preprocessor script do?

A preprocessor script is hooked before Exasol's SQL parser. This allows it to intercept and modify any SQL text sent to the database (or executed within a procedure script) before passing it on to the actual parser.

#### What can I do with it?

Those scripts are using the Lua language, so basically you can do anything with the preprocessor; here's a few facts and limitations, though:

* Exasol's Lua library is stripped and can not be extended with binary libraries for security reasons
* Preprocessor scripts do not take parameters; the "current" SQL text can be retrieved through a function call
* Preprocessor scripts**can**execute statements using (p)query
* Preprocessor scripts do not return any values; they "return" the modified SQL text through another function call
* While often preprocessor scripts are enabled on system level, any user can disable this in his or her session (see (2) below)
* Preprocessor scripts are executed in the**caller's context**and privileges. Also, if user can EXECUTE the script (which is a necessity), he/she can also READ it. Security by obscurity won't work.

##### Typical Use Cases

* Compatibility layer for a frontend that produces SQL not suitable for Exasol
* Macro magic: Expanding predefined keywords server-side
* "human knows more" optimizations of queries and filters
* Row-Level Security (    re-read the last two points above)

#### Syntax and Semantics

Please see the Exasol User Manual (Section 3.8) for details.

## Prerequisites

As a preprocessor script is a**schema object**, you will need to find or create a schema to create the script in:


```"code-sql"
create schema if not exists PREPROCESSOR; 
```
**Preconditions:**

* CREATE SCHEMAprivilege**or**pre-existing schema

## How to work with Preprocessor Script?

## Step 1: Safety

"CREATE SCRIPT" statements are also preprocessed. As the preprocessor script you are going to (re-)deploy is very likely to contain the keywords it should react on, it is advisable to disable the preprocessor before deployment:


```"code-sql"
alter session set sql_preprocessor_script = null; 
```
## Step 2: Deploy

Create the preprocessor script. Syntax "around" may depend on the SQL client you are using:


```"code-sql"
--/
create or replace Lua script MY_PREPROCESSOR()
as
    ...
    ...sqlparsing.getsqltext()
    ...
    ...sqlparsing.setsqltext(...)
    ...
    return
/
```
**Preconditions:**

* CREATE SCRIPTprivilege
* ownership of the schema**or**CREATE ANY SCRIPTprivilege

## Step 3: Activate locally

Now activate the preprocessor for your local session:


```"code-sql"
alter session set sql_preprocessor_script = PREPROCESSOR.MY_PREPROCESSOR; 
```
## Step 4: TEST IT!

Run a few statements to verify success. Best done with Auditing or Profiling enabled, so you can see the resulting SQL texts.  
When things go very wrong, go back to step (2) – This is the only SQL statement not passed through the preprocessor...

## Step 5: Activate globally

Now that things went well, we can activate the script for other users (new sessions):


```"code-sql"
alter system set sql_preprocessor_script = PREPROCESSOR.MY_PREPROCESSOR; 
```
**Preconditions:**

* ALTER SYSTEMprivilege

## Step 6: No wait, we forgot something important!

We just locked out (more or less) everyone else from the database: They don't haveEXECUTEpermissions on the script!


```"code-sql"
grant EXECUTE on PREPROCESSOR.MY_PREPROCESSOR to public; 
```
**Preconditions:**

* ownership of the schema**or**GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGEprivilege

## Additional Notes

**Best Practice:**

As step (3) replaces the script, all privileges on it are lost in that step.  
To avoid this problem, the EXECUTE privilege should be put on schema level:


```"code-sql"
grant EXECUTE on SCHEMA PREPROCESSOR to public; 
```
Just make sure you don't put anything dangerous/secret into that schema
