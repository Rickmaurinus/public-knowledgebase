# How to Skip Non-Header Rows in Import

## Question
I am trying to import the following pipe (|) separated variable file into an Exasol table:

http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqtraded.txt

I used the following SQL to create the destination table and import the contents of the file into the table.
```sql
create table nasdaq_traded (  
nasdaq_traded char(1)  
       ,symbol varchar(10)  
       ,security_name varchar(256)  
       ,listing_exchange char(1)  
       ,market_category char(1)  
       ,etf char(1)  
       ,round_lot_size int  
       ,test_issue char(1)  
       ,financial_status char(1)  
       ,cqs_symbol varchar(10)  
       ,nasdaq_symbol varchar(10)  
       ,next_shares char(1)  
);

import into stocks_data.nasdaq_traded  
        from csv at 'http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/' file 'nasdaqtraded.txt' (1..12)  
        row separator = 'CRLF'  
        column separator = '|'  
        skip = 1  
        reject limit 0;  
```
When I ran the above SQL the following error is returned:

```
[Code: 0, SQL State: 42636]  ETL-2101: Error while parsing row=9437 (starting from 0) [CSV Parser found incorrect number of columns. Expected: [12], found [6] columns in file 'nasdaqtraded.txt'] (Session: 1685652005867552768)
```

The reason for the error is that the last line of the file is a footer row that contains the file creation time. See the sample of the file showing the top 4 and bottom four rows of the file below:

|Nasdaq Traded|Symbol|Security Name|Listing Exchange|Market Category|ETF|Round Lot Size|Test Issue|Financial Status|CQS Symbol|NASDAQ Symbol|NextShares|  
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
Y|A|Agilent Technologies, Inc. Common Stock|N| |N|100|N||A|A|N  
Y|AA|Alcoa Corporation Common Stock |N| |N|100|N||AA|AA|N  
Y|AAA|Listed Funds Trust AAF First Priority CLO Bond ETF|P| |Y|100|N||AAA|AAA|N  
...  
Y|ZYME|Zymeworks Inc. Common Shares|N| |N|100|N||ZYME|ZYME|N  
Y|ZYNE|Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Common Stock|Q|G|N|100|N|N||ZYNE|N  
Y|ZYXI|Zynex, Inc. - Common Stock|Q|S|N|100|N|N||ZYXI|N  
File Creation Time:1209202018:03|||||

I know the "skip" operator can be used to ignore a specified number of rows at the top of the file. Is there an equivalent way to ignore rows at the end of a file? 

## Answer
This is one way to make it work:
```sql
import into nasdaq_traded  
from csv at 'http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/' file 'nasdaqtraded.txt' (1..12)  
row separator = 'CRLF'  
column separator = '|'  
skip = 1  
errors into error_table (current_timestamp)  
reject limit unlimited;
```
error_table is auto-generated by the IMPORT command and contains all rows that cannot be loaded. The last row in your case.
