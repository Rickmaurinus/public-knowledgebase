# SqlAlchemy and Exasol 
## Background

## SQLAlchemy

Quote from the [SQLAlchemy website](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/):


>  SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.  
> It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

It provides a database-independent layer of object management, combined with a database-specific layer ("dialect") for object persistence and data management.

## Explanation

## The Exasol Dialect

The exasol dialect for SQLAlchemy is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/blue-yonder/sqlalchemy_exasol), courtesy of [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/).

The readme on GitHub should contain enough information to get you started.
