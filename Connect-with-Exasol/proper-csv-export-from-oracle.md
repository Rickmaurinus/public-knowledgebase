Notes:

* ***Oracle SQL Developer*** automatically converts NULL to "" (empty string)
* ***Oracle SQL Developer*** automatically masks double quotes ("Example" -> ""Example"")

## Option 2):Using ***SQLcl***: ***SQLcl*** is a free tool provided by Oracle.

* Download:<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/index.html>
	+ Short documentation about how to get started and some of its features: <https://mikesmithers.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/sqlcl-the-new-sqlplus/>
* Connect to the database you want to export
* To guarantee a proper export of your data, you have to change some of the system variables of ***SQLcl***:  
o ***SET SQLFORMAT csv*** (automatic conversion into proper csv)  
o ***SET TERMOUT OFF*** (suppresses output on display - this option is only necessary when using scripts)  
o ***SET FEEDBACK OFF*** (suppresses displaying the number of records returned by a query)
* To apply each option, just press ***ENTER*** after every single command  
Note: These options have to be set every time ***SQLcl*** is started!

* Use the integrated spooler with the appended file path to start the process

* ***SQLcl*** will write the result set of your ***SELECT-statement*** to *****table1.csv*****

![](images/Oracle8.png)

* To finish the process, you have to stop the spooler by using the command: *****spool off*****

Notes:  
o You are not able to access the exported csv file until you stopped the spooler  
o ***SQLcl*** automatically masks double quotes (“Example” -> “”Example””)  
o ***SQLcl*** automatically converts NULL to “” (empty string)
