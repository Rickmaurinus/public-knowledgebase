# Migration guide: SQL Server/  Azure SQL Database to Exasol 
## Migration Guide

This article adresses some common topics when migrating from SQL Server to Exasol. It focuses on topics that arise when you have already loaded a few tables over. If you haven't already, have a look at [connecting to SQL Server from Exasol](https://docs.exasol.com/loading_data/connect_databases/sql_server.htm "Exasol") and the [database migration script](https://github.com/EXASOL/database-migration#sql-server "Exasol") for yor very first steps of loading data over.


|Topic   |SQL Server   |Exasol   |
|---|---|---|
|Syntax - Schemas   |```USE [my_schema] ```   |```OPEN SCHEMA "my_schema"; ```   |
|Syntax - Quotes   |SQL Server uses square brackets a lot. <br /> ```SELECT [my_col] FROM [my_table];```   |Exasol's default way of quoting is with double quotes: <br /> ```SELECT "my_col" FROM "my_table";```<br />Quoting with square brackets is also supported, however as double quotes are more Exasol-style, use double quotes if you have the choice.   |
|Common functions   |ISNULL → <br />GETDATE → <br />CHARINDEX →   |COALESCE <br />CURRENT_TIMESTAMP <br />LOCATE   |
|Functions   |There are some SQL Server typical functions like EOMONTH, DATEADD, CONVERT_TO_DATE, PATINDEX, … <br />```SELECT EOMONTH('2019-02-15');```   |These functions are not automatically shipped with Exasol, but you can easily add them: Download the functions you need from [EXA_TOOLBOX](https://github.com/exasol/exa-toolbox/tree/master/sqlserver_compatibility "Exasol") and change the function calls in your SQL so that they use the schema-qualified version:<br />```SELECT EXA_TOOLBOX.EOMONTH('2019-02-15');```<br />Or alternatively, create the function EOMONTH from the Toolbox in the schema that you later on want to use it, e.g.:<br />```CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "my_schema".EOMONTH(date_in IN TIMESTAMP)  …```<br />```/```<br />```SELECT EOMONTH('2019-02-15');```    |
|Stored Procedures    |Stored procedures are often used for ETL scripting with multiple steps. Here is a simple example, that performs some normalizations:<br />```CREATE procedure [procs].[normalizeGenderData] ( ```<br />``` @femaleGenderName VARCHAR(20), ```<br />``` @maleGenderName VARCHAR(20)) ```<br />```as```<br />```begin```<br />```  UPDATE Customers SET Gender=@femaleGenderName WHERE (Gender='f' OR Gender='fe');```<br />```  UPDATE Customers SET Gender=@maleGenderName WHERE (Gender='m' OR Gender='ma');```<br />```end```<br />```GO```   |Exasol also has a basic set of function, however if you used Stored Procedures in SQL Server, it's recommended to translate them into [Lua Scripts](https://docs.exasol.com/database_concepts/udf_scripts/lua.htm "Exasol") in Exasol. An equivalent Lua Script to the stored procedure example looks like this:<br />```CREATE OR REPLACE SCRIPT "procs"."normalizeGenderData"(femaleGenderName, maleGenderName) RETURNS ROWCOUNT AS```<br />```query([[open schema RETAIL]]) ```<br />```rows_updated = 0 ```<br />```res = query([[UPDATE "Customers" SET GENDER=:fgn WHERE (GENDER='f' OR GENDER='fe')]], {fgn=femaleGenderName}) ```<br />```rows_updated = rows_updated + res.rows_updated ```<br />```res = query([[UPDATE "Customers" SET GENDER=:mgn WHERE (GENDER='m' OR GENDER='ma')]],{mgn=maleGenderName}) ```<br />```rows_updated = rows_updated + res.rows_updated ```<br />```exit({rows_affected=rows_updated}) ```<br />```/```    |
